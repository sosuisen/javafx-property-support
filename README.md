# JavaFX Builder Class Generator

This VSCode extension provides a builder class generator for JavaFX projects.

You can generate builder classes for various classes included in the javafx.scene.* packages, such as Button and VBox,
allowing you to create complex instances more compactly.

# How to use

## 1. 🏃‍➡️ Move the cursor over a "new ClassName()" expression.
- The class must be in the javafx.scene.* packages.
- The class name must be a canonical name or resolved through an import.
- A builder class cannot be generated if the class has no setXXX methods.

## 2. 🔧 Press "Generate Builder Class" Code Lens.

- As a result, a builder class is generated and replaces the original class at the cursor position.

## 3. 🎁 A builder class is generated under the jfxbuilder directory.

- The builder class is named by appending the postfix "-Builder" to the original class name.

## 4. ⚙️ The builder class has the same setter methods as the original class, but the "set-" prefix is omitted.

- In the example below, the builder class for the Button class is ButtonBuilder, and instead of the setMaxSize method, it has a maxSize method. 

- The return type of the maxSize method is ButtonBuilder.

- To create an instance of the original class, call build() at the end of the method chain.
